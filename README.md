# Multi-Agent System for Automated Data Analysis
---
## INTRODUCTIONS:
This project implements a multi-agent system using Python and the LangGraph library to perform a comprehensive, step-by-step data analysis on a given dataset. The system is designed to automate the entire analytical workflow, from initial data exploration to final insight synthesis, by leveraging a team of specialized AI agents.
