3. ## Key Findings
4. - **Cholesterol**: 129 entries have value 0, which may indicate missing or erroneous data.
5. - **Correlation with HeartDisease**: 
6.   - MaxHR has the strongest negative correlation (-0.407) with HeartDisease.
7.   - Oldpeak has a moderate positive correlation (0.377) with HeartDisease.
8.   - FastingBS has a moderate positive correlation (0.261) with HeartDisease.
9.   - Age has a weak positive correlation (0.245) with HeartDisease.
10.   - Cholesterol has a moderate negative correlation (-0.241) with HeartDisease.
11. - **Group Differences (T-test)**: MaxHR is significantly lower in patients with HeartDisease (p < 0.0001).
12. - **Categorical Associations (Chi-squared)**: Sex is strongly associated with HeartDisease (p < 0.0001).
13. - **HeartDisease Prevalence by Category**:
14.   - Males: 62.5% have HeartDisease vs. 28.4% in females.
15.   - ExerciseAngina='Yes': 84.7% have HeartDisease vs. 35.0% when 'No'.
16.   - ChestPainType='ASY' (Asymptomatic): 78.7% have HeartDisease, the highest among all types.
17.   - ChestPainType='ATA' (Atypical Angina): Only 14.0% have HeartDisease, the lowest.

19. ## Statistical Significance Summary
20. - All reported p-values are < 0.001, indicating statistically significant associations.
21. 
22. ## Recommendations
23. - Consider imputing or flagging zero cholesterol values as potential data errors.
24. - Features such as MaxHR, ExerciseAngina, ChestPainType, and Sex are strong predictors and should be prioritized in modeling.
25. - The strong association between ExerciseAngina and HeartDisease suggests physiological stress as a key indicator.
