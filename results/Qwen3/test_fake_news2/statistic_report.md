1. ### Statistical Analysis Report
2. 1. **Dataset Overview**: The cleaned sampled dataset contains 1,800 news articles with no missing values.
3. 2. **Class Distribution**: The target variable `label` is binary: 1,066 real news articles (label = 0) and 733 fake news articles (label = 1), indicating a moderate class imbalance.
4. 3. **Correlation Analysis**: The label column is binary (0/1), so correlation with itself is 1.0. No numeric predictors exist to compute additional correlations.
5. 4. **Conclusion**: The dataset is suitable for binary classification. The class imbalance is not severe and can be addressed during modeling with techniques like class weighting or resampling.
6. 5. **Recommendation**: Proceed to feature engineering using text preprocessing (TF-IDF, tokenization) on the `text` column to extract numerical features for modeling.
