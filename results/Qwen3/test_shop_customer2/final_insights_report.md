- No major data quality issues; missing values handled appropriately.

## Recommendations

1. **Marketing Campaigns**: Tailor messaging per segment (e.g., savings for Segment 2 & 4, luxury for Segment 5).
2. **Product Bundling**: Create family packages for Segment 3 and premium bundles for Segment 5.
3. **Retention Strategy**: Identify at-risk segments (e.g., Segment 1 may grow into Segment 2 or 4).
4. **Channel Optimization**: Use digital channels for young segments (1, 4), direct mail or in-store for older segments (3, 5).

## Next Steps

- Deploy clustering model for real-time customer scoring.
- Integrate with CRM to auto-tag customers.
