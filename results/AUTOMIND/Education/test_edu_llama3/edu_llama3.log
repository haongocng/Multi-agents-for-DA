    Please analyze the 'edudata_english.csv' dataset and perform a full classification analysis on 'edudata_english.csv' dataset. Now your task is to predict the 'I am willing to share my digital skills with other students' field in the data.
    Do the workflow: DataExplorer -> FeatureEngineering -> ModelSelection -> ModelTraining-> ModelEvaluation -> Prediction -> Synthesis.
    Note that: the final evaluation report MUST include the following metrics, calculated on the test set: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score. You must use the `execute_code` tool to run all your code.
