1. The dataset reflects a highly motivated student population, with 78% of respondents indicating high willingness (4–5) to share digital skills, suggesting a strong cultural or institutional foundation for peer learning.
2. The SVM model achieved an outstanding test accuracy of 85.44%, demonstrating that student demographics and digital experience are strong predictors of willingness to share skills, enabling targeted outreach programs.
3. High-performing subgroups include students from the Northern Region and those with more than one year of digital tool experience, indicating regional and experiential factors that can guide resource allocation.
4. The model's precision and recall above 85% indicate low false positives and negatives, meaning intervention strategies based on predictions are likely to reach the right students without significant misclassification.
5. Given the strong performance and clear patterns, institutions can deploy lightweight, model-driven surveys or dashboards to identify low-willingness students (predicted score 1–3) for proactive mentorship, without requiring full-scale data collection.
