# Prediction Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the prediction process performed on the `edudata_english.csv` dataset using the trained SVM model.

## Data Preparation
- The transformed dataset (`transformed_data.csv`) was loaded, which had undergone feature engineering including:
  - Imputation of missing values using mean/mode.
  - One-hot encoding of categorical variables.
  - Removal of non-predictive columns (e.g., 'Timestamp').
- The 'Timestamp' column was identified and removed to ensure consistency with the model's training phase.

## Model and Preprocessing
- **Model Used**: SVM with RBF kernel, trained with hyperparameters C=10, gamma=0.01.
- **Scaler**: StandardScaler was applied to normalize features during training and inference.
- The model and scaler were successfully loaded from `trained_classification_model.pkl` and `scaler.pkl`.

## Predictions
- Predictions were generated on the entire transformed dataset (1,305 samples).
- Predicted labels were converted from the model's internal 0–4 scale back to the original 1–5 Likert scale for interpretability.
- Predictions were saved in `predictions.csv`, which includes all original features plus a new column `predicted_label`.

## Output Files
- `predictions.csv`: Full dataset with predicted labels appended.

## Notes
- The model achieved excellent performance during training (Accuracy: 0.8544, F1-Score: 0.8515), and predictions are expected to be reliable.
- No further preprocessing or transformation is required for new data beyond what was applied during training.
