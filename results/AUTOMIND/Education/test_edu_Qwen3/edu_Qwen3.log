The `'Timestamp'` column was identified as a non-numeric string column and removed.\n   - The target variable was adjusted from labels [1,2,3,4,5] to [0,1,2,3,4] to ensure compatibility with scikit-learn and XGBoost libraries.\n\n3. **Models Evaluated**:\n   - Random Forest\n   - XGBoost\n   - Logistic Regression\n   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)\n   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\n\n4. **Performance Metrics (Test Set, Weighted Averaged)**:\n   - **Random Forest**: Accuracy: 0.8429, Precision: 0.8405, Recall: 0.8429, F1-Score: 0.8389, ROC-AUC: 0.9428\n   - **XGBoost**: Accuracy: 0.8276, Precision: 0.8256, Recall: 0.8276, F1-Score: 0.8253, ROC-AUC: 0.9342\n   - **Logistic Regression**: Accuracy: 0.8429, Precision: 0.8415, Recall: 0.8429, F1-Score: 0.8401, ROC-AUC: 0.9299\n   - **SVM**: Accuracy: 0.8467, Precision: 0.8448, Recall: 0.8467, F1-Score: 0.8440, ROC-AUC: 0.9417\n   - **K-Nearest Neighbors**: Accuracy: 0.7893, Precision: 0.7948, Recall: 0.7893, F1-Score: 0.7907, ROC-AUC: 0.9049\n\n5. **Selection Rationale**:\n   - **SVM achieved the highest performance** across all critical metrics: Accuracy (0.8467), Precision (0.8448), Recall (0.8467), and F1-Score (0.8440), with a competitive ROC-AUC of 0.9417.\n   - Random Forest and Logistic Regression performed nearly identically and were slightly behind SVM.\n   - XGBoost showed slightly lower performance than SVM, possibly due to the relatively small dataset size and high class imbalance (majority class 5 dominates).\n   - KNN underperformed significantly, likely due to the curse of dimensionality (36 features) and imbalance.\n\n6. **Recommendation**:\n   - **Best Model**: **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** with RBF kernel.\n   - SVM is robust to high-dimensional data and performs well on moderately imbalanced datasets, making it ideal for this classification task.\n   -
