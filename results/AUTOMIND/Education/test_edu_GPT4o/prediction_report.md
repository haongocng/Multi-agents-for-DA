# Prediction Report

## Overview
The prediction process was conducted using the trained XGBoost model. The task was to predict the willingness of students to share their digital skills with others, based on various features derived from the `edudata_english.csv` dataset.

## Data Preparation
- The dataset was transformed and prepared through feature engineering, which included handling missing values, encoding categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding, and scaling numerical features.
- The final transformed dataset consisted of 801 features, excluding the target variable.

## Model and Prediction
- The XGBoost model, previously trained and evaluated, was used for prediction.
- Predictions were successfully generated for the entire dataset, excluding the target variable.

## Output
- The predictions were saved in a CSV file named `predictions.csv`.
- Each entry in the file corresponds to the predicted willingness of a student to share digital skills.

## Conclusion
The prediction process was completed successfully, and the results are ready for further analysis or integration into decision-making processes.
