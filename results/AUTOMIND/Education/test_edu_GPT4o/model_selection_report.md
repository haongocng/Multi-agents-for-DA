1. ## Model Selection Report
2. 1. **Models Considered**:
3.    - Random Forest Classifier
4.    - XGBoost Classifier
5. 2. **Performance Metrics**:
6.    - **Random Forest Classifier**:
7.      - Accuracy: 0.9655
8.      - Precision: 0.9681
9.      - Recall: 0.9959
10.      - F1-Score: 0.9818
11.      - ROC-AUC: 0.9326
12.    - **XGBoost Classifier**:
13.      - Accuracy: 0.9693
14.      - Precision: 0.9720
15.      - Recall: 0.9959
16.      - F1-Score: 0.9838
17.      - ROC-AUC: 0.9074
18. 3. **Model Selected**:
19.    - Based on the performance metrics, both models performed exceptionally well; however, the XGBoost model slightly outperformed the Random Forest in terms of accuracy and F1-Score. Therefore, the XGBoost Classifier is selected as the best model for this classification task.
20. 4. **Rationale**:
21.    - The selection is primarily based on higher accuracy and F1-Score, which are crucial for balanced class performance. The XGBoost model's ability to handle complex patterns and interactions likely contributed to its superior performance.
