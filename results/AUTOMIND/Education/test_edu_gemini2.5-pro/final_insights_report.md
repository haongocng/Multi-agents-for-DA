1. # Final Insights Report

## High-Level Summary

Our analysis reveals that it is possible to predict with approximately 80% accuracy which students are willing to share their digital skills with their peers. This willingness is a key indicator of a student's overall engagement with digital learning. Students who are open to sharing are also more proactive in their own digital skill development and are more likely to champion the use of technology in the classroom.

## Key Insights

1.  **Digital Champions Are Identifiable:** A core group of students, whom we can call "Digital Champions," are not only willing to share their skills but are also eager to learn more and promote digital tools. These students are a valuable asset for fostering a digital learning culture.

2.  **Predictive Model for Engagement:** The developed Random Forest model can effectively identify these Digital Champions. This allows for targeted engagement strategies to leverage their enthusiasm and expertise.

3.  **Confidence in Identifying Champions:** The model is most accurate in identifying students who are *very* willing to share their skills. This high level of confidence enables the creation of reliable programs built around these key students.

## Actionable Recommendations

*   **Establish a "Digital Champions" Program:** Use the model to identify and recruit students for a peer-to-peer digital skills mentoring program. These students can lead workshops, provide one-on-one support, and act as liaisons between students and faculty on digital learning matters.

*   **Provide Targeted Support for Less Engaged Students:** The model can also help identify students who are less willing to share their skills. These students may benefit from targeted workshops, more personalized support, or incentives to build their confidence and skills in a lower-pressure environment.

*   **Refine Data Collection for Deeper Insights:** The model's lower accuracy for less-willing students highlights a need for more data on these groups. Future surveys should be designed to gather more nuanced feedback from these students to better understand their barriers and motivations.
