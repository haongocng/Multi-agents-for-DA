# Prediction Report

## 1. Introduction

This report summarizes the process of generating predictions using the trained classification model. The goal was to predict the likelihood of students being willing to share their digital skills.

## 2. Process

The prediction process involved the following steps:

1.  **Loading Data**: The `transformed_data.csv` dataset, which was preprocessed and feature-engineered, was loaded.
2.  **Loading Model**: The trained Random Forest classification model was loaded from `trained_classification_model.pkl`.
3.  **Generating Predictions**: The model was used to generate predictions on the `transformed_data.csv` dataset.
4.  **Saving Predictions**: The predictions were added as a new column named 'predictions' to the original data and saved as `predictions.csv`.

## 3. Output

The final output is the `predictions.csv` file, which contains the original data along with the predictions made by the model. This file can be used for further analysis or for deploying the model's insights.
