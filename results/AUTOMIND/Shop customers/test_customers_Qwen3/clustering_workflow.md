1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Customers.csv to assess data quality, distributions, and missing values.
2. Conduct statistical analysis on numerical features: Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score to identify correlations and distributions.
3. Apply feature engineering: encode Gender and Profession, scale numerical features (Age, Annual Income, Spending Score), and handle outliers.
4. Apply K-Means clustering (K=5) on engineered features to segment customers.
5. Generate cluster visualizations: pairplots and 3D scatter plots to interpret groupings.
6. Formulate hypotheses about each cluster’s behavior (e.g., high-income low-spending, young high-spending).
7. Reason over cluster profiles using statistical summaries to describe each group’s characteristics.
8. Synthesize final insights with actionable business recommendations.
