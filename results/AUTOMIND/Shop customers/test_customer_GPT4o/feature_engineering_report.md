1. Loaded the dataset 'Customers.csv' with utf-8 encoding.
2. Handled missing values by imputing mean for numerical columns and mode for categorical columns.
3. Encoded categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding, resulting in new binary columns for each category.
4. Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler to standardize the data.
5. Saved the transformed data to 'transformed_data.csv'.
6. The transformed dataset now has 17 columns, with all missing values handled and appropriate scaling applied.
