# Prediction Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the prediction process performed on the test dataset using the trained Naive Bayes classification model.

## Model and Data
- **Model**: Trained Naive Bayes classifier (saved as `trained_classification_model.pkl`)
- **Vectorizer**: CountVectorizer (max_features=5000) from feature engineering pipeline
- **Test Dataset**: `test.csv` (loaded with UTF-8 encoding and tab separator)

## Prediction Process
1. The `test.csv` file was loaded with `encoding='utf-8'` and `sep='\t'`.
2. The `text` column was converted to string type for consistency.
3. The same CountVectorizer (previously fitted on the training data) was applied to transform the test text data into feature vectors.
4. The trained Naive Bayes model generated binary predictions (0 = real, 1 = fake) for each article.

## Output
- Predictions were appended as a new column `prediction` to the test dataset.
- The enriched dataset was saved as `predictions.csv`.

## Summary of Predictions
- Total predictions made: [number of rows in test.csv]
- Distribution of predictions:
  - Real (0): [count of 0s]
  - Fake (1): [count of 1s]

## Notes
- The feature engineering steps matched those applied during training: text vectorization only, no label encoding (since test data has no labels).
- The model was loaded using `joblib` due to compatibility with the saved format.
