1. 1. Loaded the sampled dataset `sampled_dataset.csv` using UTF-8 encoding.
2. 2. Identified and removed one row where the `label` column contained the erroneous value `'label'`, which was likely a header contamination.
3. 3. Converted the remaining string labels `'0'` and `'1'` into binary integers `0` (real) and `1` (fake) for compatibility with binary classification models.
4. 4. Verified that the cleaned `label` column now contains only binary values `[0, 1]` with a class distribution of 1066 real and 733 fake articles.
5. 5. Saved the cleaned and transformed dataset as `transformed_data.csv`.
6. 6. Confirmed the final DataFrame has 1799 rows with no missing values and appropriate data types (`text` as object, `label` as int64).
