- Dataset shape: (1800, 2)
- Data types: `text` and `label` as object (string)
- No missing values
- Descriptive statistics and value counts for `label`
- Identification of a data quality issue: the `label` column contains an unexpected third value `'label'`, suggesting possible header contamination or mislabeling

## Model Selection Report
### Models Evaluated
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes
- XGBoost

### Dataset
- Source: `transformed_data.csv` (1,799 samples)
- Binary classification: 0 (real), 1 (fake)
- Text features vectorized using CountVectorizer (max_features=5000)

### Performance Metrics (Validation Set)
| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | ROC-AUC |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Logistic Regression | 0.7333 | 0.7179 | 0.5714 | 0.6364 | 0.7739 |
| Random Forest | 0.7167 | 0.9245 | 0.3333 | 0.4900 | 0.7447 |

| XGBoost | 0.7083 | 0.6909 | 0.5170 | 0.5914 | 0.7682 |

### Analysis
- Naive Bayes achieved the highest F1-score (0.6507), which is critical for imbalanced classification tasks.
- Logistic Regression had the highest accuracy (0.7333) and ROC-AUC (0.7739), indicating good overall discrimination.
- Random Forest showed high precision but very low recall, indicating it fails to identify many fake news articles (high false negatives).
- XGBoost performed reasonably but was outperformed by Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression in this initial evaluation.
- Given the text-based nature of the data and moderate class imbalance, Naive Bayes is particularly well-suited due to its efficiency and performance on sparse textual features.

### Recommendation
Select **Naive Bayes** as the baseline classification model for further development. It offers the best balance of F1-score and computational efficiency on this text classification task. Logistic Regression is a close second and may be explored for fine-tuning.

### Next Steps
- Proceed to ModelTraining agent to train the Naive Bayes model on the full `train.csv` dataset.
- Ensure feature engineering (text vectorization) is consistently applied to the full dataset.
