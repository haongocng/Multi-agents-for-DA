Follow­ing therap­y, actor has come to realis­e that Jen was the love of his life  Fans who’ve been rooting for Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston ever since their 2005 split may actually have cause for hope! Years later, Brad regrets leaving the Friends star for his now-ex Angelina Jolie, a source told In Touch exclusively.  Following his 2016 separation from Angie, Brad sobered up and sought therapy. And now, he’s “in touch with emotions and his true self like never before,” the source says.  Brad Pitt finally opens up about his bitter divorce with Angelina Jolie  And it seems like this self-awareness comes with some great realisations. “He has come to realise that leaving Jen for Angelina was one of the biggest mistakes of his life,” the source adds. “And while he’s not in love with Jen, he realises how much he does love her. Brad keeps telling friends that he’s seeing everything more clearly.”  However, these realisations are obviously far too late. Jennifer has been married to Wanderlust co-star Justin Theroux for two years now.  And while Brad would “never dream of” ruining his ex’s new marriage, he “would take a second chance at love with Jen in a heartbeat.”  If they can’t be romantic partners, though, the War Machine star wants Jen to be his partner in other pursuits, In Touch further reported.  Brad Pitt “much happier” following split from Angelina Jolie  “They worked well together” when they formed the production company Plan B in 2001, an insider close to Brad told In Touch. “He wants Jen involved again as he produces and develops more and more high-quality film and cable TV products.”  That kind of professional partnership could pay off for Jen, too, since the insider states she wants in on “prestige projects” under his production banner. “She’d be beyond thrilled to win an Academy Award for Best Actress — something that’s evaded both her and Angelina.”  “He still considers Jen the love of his life,” the source concluded.

Shay Mitchell had a very special way of thanking her fans for subscribing to her YouTube channel.  The former Pretty Little Liars star celebrated three million YouTube subscribers by running nearly naked through Hollywood -- and documented the whole thing in a video for her followers.  In a video titled, "I Ran Naked Through the Streets of LA!" Mitchell did just that, as her assistant, Sammy filmed her running topless down Sunset Boulevard.  “I can’t tell you how much this means to me to have you guys coming along since when I first started the channel is was uncharted territories and now it’s just a learning experience every single week,” Mitchell said of her big YouTube milestone before stripping down.  “While I wasn’t intending on sharing this video with anybody, I thought, ‘Why the heck not?’” she continued.

Nicole Kidman is fearless!  The 51-year-old Big Little Lies star was her family’s hero on Sunday when she captured a giant black tarantula, who was seemingly making himself at home by the star’s swimming pool.  In the clip posted to Instagram, Kidman’s daughters Faith Margaret, 7, and Sunday Rose, 10, can be heard screaming in horror as she approached the eight-legged creature with no apprehension.  “Get back, mom! Step back!” one of the girls shouts. The other then yells, “It’s a tarantula, right mom?”  Showing her laidback Australian attitude towards creepy crawlies, Kidman then turns the camera to face her, showing fans she has the spider trapped inside a glass.  “I’m having to take care of this spider, help,” Kidman says at the end of the video.  Despite getting caught, the spider was very lucky as the star opted to release it rather than kill it.  “House guest! Catch and release… spider released unharmed and healthy ❤️Happy Sunday,” Kidman captioned the image.

Back in January, Kidman ate a four-course meal of bugs with chopsticks on Vanity Fair’s “Secret Talent Theatre.”  RELATED ARTICLE: Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban Reminisce on 12th Wedding Anniversary: ‘Feels Like It Was Yesterday’  After eating her first course of hornworms, Kidman says “Two billion people in the world eat bugs and I’m one of them.”  She then went on to eat mealworms, crickets, and grasshoppers for her last course.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1
After multiple plastic surgeries and a MRSA infection on his nose, Rodrigo Alves, aka the ‘Human Ken doll,’ is at risk of losing it altogether.  Alves, 33, can no longer breathe through his nose, and it’s so severely damaged that he heads to the Botched doctors for help on Sunday’s episode.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “His nostrils are so small, and after what he’s gone through with the MRSA, this is probably one of the worst results and complications that I’ve seen in my entire career,” Dr. Paul Nassif says in this exclusive clip.  “The issue is that what we call the ‘soft tissue envelope,’ that’s the skin. So by you having three surgeries in a time of 12 to 15 months, you destroyed your tissue,” Dr. Nassif tells Alves as Dr. Terry Dubrow looks on. “The skin’s no good.”  Dr. Nassif was unable to properly examine Alves’ nostrils, because there was no space to fit an otoscope.  “I feel like crying right now, but I’m holding back not to cry. Because I’m actually very, extremely worried, that’s why I’m here,” Alves tells Dr. Nassif.  “My nose was perfect, after this last rhinoplasty,” Alves adds. “And my friends, they never had this problem at all. And I was the unlucky one. So I keep asking myself now, ‘Why me?’ “  Alves told PEOPLE in February that he’s undergone 51 plastic surgeries, and 105 aesthetic treatments, for a total of 375,000 pounds (or about $465,000) in medical costs.  RELATED VIDEO: Would Dr. Terry and Heather Dubrow Let Their Kids Ever Get Plastic Surgery?!  Dr. Nassif says that any further surgery is too risky while Alves’ nose is still healing from his last surgery.  “Now that you just had surgery three months ago, it’s going to scar down more, it’s in a healing phase,” Dr. Nassif says. “If you try to insult your skin one more time now while it’s healing, there’s a high possibility that if you let one of these doctors touch your nose now, this will turn black and then die and fall off.”  That elicits a gasp from Alves. See what he and the doctors decide on Sunday’s episode of Botched, airing at 9/8c on E!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1
Updated | A new book by Donna Brazile, the former interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), has been making headlines for its controversial claims about the 2016 presidential election and the Hillary Clinton campaign. But the provocative points start even before the first chapter, as Brazile reportedly dedicated the book in part to Seth Rich, the DNC staffer whose murder launched a conspiracy theory.Axios reported on Sunday that the book's dedication reads, “In loving memory of my father, Lionel Brazile Sr.; my beloved sister, Sheila Brazile; my fearless uncles Nat, Floyd, and Douglas; Harlem’s finest, my aunt Lucille; my friend and mentor, David Kaufmann; my DNC colleague and patriot, Seth Rich; and my beloved Pomeranian, Chip Joshua Marvin Brazile (Booty Wipes). I miss y’all.”Related: TV Ad With Russian Subtitles Questions Seth Rich’s MurderRich, 27, was fatally shot in July 2016 while walking home late at night in Washington, D.C. The police believe the shooting was a robbery gone wrong. But Rich worked for the DNC, and WikiLeaks published thousands of emails from the committee two weeks after his death. That timeline provoked theories that Rich had given the materials to WikiLeaks and that his death was an attempt to stop him from doing so, or to punish him for it.Media reports had characterized Rich as a low-level staffer, and his parents wrote in an opinion piece for The Washington Post in May, “Those who have suggested that Seth’s role as a data analyst at the DNC gave him access to a wide trove of emails are simply incorrect.”SAUL LOEB/AFP/GettyRich appears elsewhere in Brazile’s book, as the Post reported earlier in the weekend. She wrote that Rich’s murder haunted her and that she'd installed surveillance cameras at her home and would keep the blinds in her office window closed so she could not be seen by snipers, according to the Post.Keep up with this story and more by subscribing nowBrazile talked about Rich on ABC News’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos on Sunday. She told the host about her critics: “They don’t know what it was like to be over the DNC during this hacking. They don’t know what it’s like to bury a child. I did: Seth Rich.”Brazile had spoken publicly about Rich’s death before. In March, she said she was going to an Omaha, Nebraska, synagogue to speak about him. In May, she tweeted, “Seth Rich was a hard worker and proud to be an American. This desire to scar Seth’s legacy to his country and party is shameful.” About two months later, after Fox News published a since debunked story about the case, she tweeted, “Seth was a good soul and look at this shameful act.”Through spokesman Brad Bauman, the Rich family said in a statement, “Since Seth was murdered, Donna Brazile has been a great friend to the Rich family and has been extremely supportive of the family’s efforts to find Seth’s killers.”In the book, out Tuesday, Brazile also writes that she weighed the possibility of replacing Clinton as the Democratic presidential nominee with former Vice President Joe Biden, according to the Post. She also reportedly wrote that Clinton’s campaign headquarters seemed “antiseptic, like a hospital,” and that she felt as though the Clinton campaign was treating her like a “slave.” In an excerpt that Politico published on November 2, she wrote about how the Clinton campaign worked out a fundraising agreement with the DNC and exercised control over the party long before Clinton became the nominee.Former aides to the Clinton campaign have challenged Brazile’s claims. In a November 4 open letter, more than 100 former top aides wrote, “It is particularly troubling and puzzling that she would seemingly buy into false Russian-fueled propaganda, spread by both the Russians and our opponent, about our candidate’s health.”Brazile was not available for comment through her publisher, Hachette Book Group, or through Georgetown University, where she is a faculty member. The publisher was unavailable to verify the reported wording of the book dedication.This article has been updated to alter the spelling of the last name of Sheila Brazile, which was misspelled as Brazioutlanle by another media outlet.    1
Three years have passed since Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton divorced, but the superstar of country music is always mending the pieces of his broken heart.  In the second part of her interview with Holly Gleason of HITS Daily Double, which was published on Tuesday, Lambert reveals why she avoided the press leading up to her 2016 album, The Weight of These Wings . Lambert detailed his separation from Shelton in the deeply personal project, which went platinum and won the album of the year at the awards of ACM 2017.  Of his decision to make the 39 Deadlock on a promotional tour, Lambert shared: "It was going to be hell, and I had already gone through hell, it was hell to put it on paper, put my words on the paper.  "I finally arrived at a place where I was no longer sad," she continued. "All the moments of sadness were there, all the truths were right in these songs, it was enough to listen, I did not need to say anything.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1
