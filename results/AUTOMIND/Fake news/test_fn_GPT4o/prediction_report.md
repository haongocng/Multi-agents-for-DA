3. **Feature Transformation**:
   - The text data from the test set was transformed using the loaded `TfidfVectorizer`.

4. **Prediction**:
   - Predictions were made using the loaded model on the transformed test data.
   - The predicted labels were added as a new column to the test data.

5. **Output**:
   - The predictions were saved to a new CSV file named `predictions.csv`.

6. **Summary**:
   - The process was completed successfully with all steps executed as planned.
