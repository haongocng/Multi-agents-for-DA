    full_train_datapath: train.csv (if want to read the full train data, please use 'encoding="utf-8"' and 'sep='	' to load the data)

    task: Binary Classification
    target_column: label
    objective: >
    Build a model to classify news articles as fake or real. The target 'label' is 1 for fake and 0 for true.
    
    IMPORTANT STRATEGY: This is a large dataset. To ensure efficiency, please adhere to the following workflow:
    1. First, For all initial analysis steps (Data Exploration, Statistics, Feature Engineering, and Model Selection), all agents MUST use the smaller 'sampled_data.csv'.
    2. For the final model training step, the ModelTraining agent MUST load the FULL 'train.csv' dataset. It should then re-apply the feature engineering steps that were developed on the sample data to the full dataset before training the final model.
    3. After the final model is trained on the full data, use it to predict the labels for the articles in 'test.csv'.
    The final evaluation metric is Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score. You must use the `execute_code` tool to run all your code.
    
    ---
    
    **MLOps PRINCIPLE: PIPELINE CONSISTENCY & STATE MANAGEMENT**
    To prevent critical errors like `ValueError`, all agents MUST strictly follow these rules:
    1.  **Stateful Objects (Vectorizers, Scalers, etc.):** Any object that is "fitted" on the training data (e.g., `TfidfVectorizer`, `StandardScaler`) **MUST be saved to a file** (e.g., using `pickle`) during the training/feature engineering phase. For the prediction phase on the test data, the agent **MUST load this exact saved object** to transform the new data. **NEVER refit or create a new object on the test data.** This ensures feature consistency.
    2.  **Consistent Preprocessing:** The entire sequence of data cleaning and preprocessing steps (handling missing values, text cleaning, feature creation) applied to the training data **MUST be identically replicated** on the test data before making predictions.
    3.  **Data Validation:** Before performing critical operations, agents should perform sanity checks. For instance, before converting a column's data type, check for unexpected values. Before prediction, ensure the number of features in the test data matches the number of features the model was trained on. This prevents data integrity errors.

    ---
    
    **DATA LOADING & ERROR HANDLING STRATEGY:**
    - **This is a critical, mandatory instruction:** When the `ModelTraining` agent loads the full `train.csv` file, it **MUST ALWAYS, BY DEFAULT**, include the `on_bad_lines='skip'` parameter in the `pd.read_csv` command.
    - **Reasoning:** The full `train.csv` dataset is known to contain malformed rows. Using `on_bad_lines='skip'` from the start is a required step to prevent predictable parsing errors, not a fallback option.
    - The agent must still use `encoding='utf-8'` and `sep='	'`.
    - After successfully loading the data (while skipping bad rows), the agent should output a summary confirming the action, for example: "Successfully loaded train.csv with shape (X, Y) using on_bad_lines='skip' to handle formatting errors."

    ---

    CRITICAL OUTPUT RULE: To prevent system errors, all code executed via the `execute_code` tool MUST follow this rule:
    - NEVER print raw dataframes (e.g., `print(df)` or `print(df.head())`).
    - Instead, the code's final output MUST be a CONCISE STRING summarizing the findings or results.
    - This rule is mandatory for all agents to ensure stable execution.
    
    Note that: if all agents need to read_document to check the data, they must read a small sample in sampled_data.csv, not the full data.

Based on the task and strategy provided, the initial plan for the binary classification workflow is as follows:

1. **Data Exploration**: Use the `sampled_dataset.csv` for exploratory data analysis to understand the data distribution and basic statistics.
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Perform statistical tests on the `sampled_dataset.csv` to identify any significant correlations or distributions.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Develop features using the `sampled_dataset.csv` and save any stateful objects for later use.
4. **Model Selection**: Evaluate and select the best classification model using the `sampled_dataset.csv`.
5. **Model Training**: Load the full `train.csv` dataset, reapply the feature engineering steps, and train the final model.
6. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict labels for the `test.csv` dataset.
7. **Quality Review**: Review the overall process and ensure consistency.
8. **Synthesis**: Generate final insights and actionable recommendations.

The feature engineering process on the `sampled_dataset.csv` has been completed. Here are the key points:

1. **Missing Values Handling**: No missing values were found in the dataset, so no imputation was necessary.
2. **Encoding Categorical Variables**: The 'label' column was one-hot encoded resulting in three new columns: 'label_0', 'label_1', and 'label_label'.
3. **Scaling Numerical Features**: No numerical features were present in the sample data for scaling.
4. **Stateful Objects**: The OneHotEncoder used for encoding the 'label' column was saved as 'label_encoder.pkl'.
5. **Output**: The transformed data was saved to 'transformed_data.csv' with shape (1800, 4).

The transformation steps have been documented in the `feature_engineering_report.md`.

Next, the ModelSelection agent can proceed with evaluating and selecting the best model using the transformed data from `transformed_data.csv`.

ValueError: could not convert string to float: "Hollywood insiders have revealed to OK! USA that the former couple are taking steps to get their marriage back on track.    'They�ve called off their legal attack dogs and are working through the logistics of withdrawing their divorce petitions� They don�t want to throw away the 11 years they spent together,' a source spilled to the magazine.    The pair have been spending more time together ever since Ange, 42, and the kids moved into a mansion just down the road from Brad, 54, making it easier for the Fight Club star to spend more time with their children Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11 and twins Knox and Vivienne, nine.  Pitt and Jolie share six children Getty  'Things are so much better among the entire family now,' continues the insider, confessing that Brad is now fully committed to being sober.    'He�s sober and attending weekly therapy sessions. Even with all the drama, he�s come out a better person, and he�s grateful to Angie for kicking him in the pants when he needed it most.'    In fact, the shock split may have been Angie�s plan to get Brad to shape up.    Court documents obtained by the publication show the actress is still signing papers using her married name and that the pair have asked the court to extend the 'temporary judge' in their case so it remains private.    'Brad and Ange clearly don�t want the divorce to be finalised,' pills the source.    'When they�re ready, they plan to request that the court withdraw the divorce petition once and for all.'    In fact, there�s even a secret plan for a vow renewal ceremony once the petitions have been withdrawn!    'It�ll be a spiritual reconnection. Brad wants Maddox to be his best man, as a way to put what happened on that plane to rest once and for all.    'Shiloh and Knox will be in charge of food and music selection. And Zahara and Viv want to help their mum pick out a dress.'"
