1. ### Comprehensive Summary
2. 1. **Data Overview**:
3.    - The dataset used for analysis contains 1800 rows with two main columns: `text` and `label`.
4.    - The `label` column is the target for the binary classification task, where '0' indicates true (real) articles and '1' indicates fake articles.
5. 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
6.    - The dataset is well-structured with no missing values.
7.    - The `text` column has a high number of unique entries, indicating diverse content.
8.    - The `label` distribution shows a higher number of real articles compared to fake ones.
9. 3. **Statistical Analysis**:
10.    - The correlation analysis was limited to the `label` column, showing expected results.
11. 4. **Modeling and Prediction**:
12.    - XGBoost was selected as the preferred model for classification.
13.    - The model was trained on the full dataset and used to predict labels for the test dataset.
14.    - Predictions were successfully saved for further evaluation.
