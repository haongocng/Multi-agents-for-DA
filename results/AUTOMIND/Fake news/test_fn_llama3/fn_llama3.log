    task: Binary Classification
    target_column: label
    objective: >
    Build a model to classify news articles as fake or real. The target 'label' is 1 for fake and 0 for true.
    
    IMPORTANT STRATEGY: This is a large dataset. To ensure efficiency, please adhere to the following workflow:
    1. First, For all initial analysis steps (Data Exploration, Statistics, Feature Engineering, and Model Selection), all agents MUST use the smaller 'sampled_data.csv'.
    2. For the final model training step, the ModelTraining agent MUST load the FULL 'train.csv' dataset. It should then re-apply the feature engineering steps that were developed on the sample data to the full dataset before training the final model.
    3. After the final model is trained on the full data, use it to predict the labels for the articles in 'test.csv'.
    The final evaluation metric is Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score. You must use the `execute_code` tool to run all your code.
    
    ---

    **DATA LOADING & ERROR HANDLING STRATEGY:**
    - In the first step Data Exploration, you MUST use the 'sampled_dataset.csv' and MUST NOT print the eda summary directly, MUST NOT use `info_buffer = StringIO()` to capture output, MUST NOT use function. Instead, you Just Only need to save the EDA report to a file named `eda_report.txt` in the working directory and output a concise summary string.
    - **This is a critical, mandatory instruction:** When the `ModelTraining` agent loads the full `train.csv` file, it **MUST ALWAYS, BY DEFAULT**, include the `on_bad_lines='skip'` parameter in the `pd.read_csv` command.
    - **Reasoning:** The full `train.csv` dataset is known to contain malformed rows. Using `on_bad_lines='skip'` from the start is a required step to prevent predictable parsing errors, not a fallback option.
    - when using the full `train.csv` dataset, the agent must still use `encoding='utf-8'` and `sep='	'`.
    - After successfully loading the data (while skipping bad rows), the agent should output a summary confirming the action, for example: "Successfully loaded train.csv with shape (X, Y) using on_bad_lines='skip' to handle formatting errors."

    ---

    **DATA CLEANSING & VALIDATION STRATEGY:**
    - **This is a mandatory data integrity check:** The raw `train.csv` is known to have data quality issues beyond just malformed rows. Specifically, the target column ('label') may contain non-numeric values (e.g., the string 'label' from a misplaced header).
    - **CRITICAL ACTION:** To prevent `ValueError` during data type conversion, the `ModelTraining` agent **MUST** perform the following cleansing sequence immediately after loading the full `train.csv` dataframe:
        1.  First, use `pd.to_numeric` on the 'label' column with the `errors='coerce'` parameter. This will safely convert all valid numbers and turn any invalid strings into `NaN` (Not a Number).
        2.  Second, immediately chain a `.dropna()` call on the dataframe for the subset of the 'label' column to permanently remove these corrupted rows.
        3.  Only after completing these two steps should the agent proceed to convert the 'label' column to `int` and continue with the rest of the workflow.
    - **Example Logic:** `df['label'] = pd.to_numeric(df['label'], errors='coerce')` followed by `df.dropna(subset=['label'], inplace=True)`
    
    ---
    
    **MLOps PRINCIPLE: PIPELINE CONSISTENCY & STATE MANAGEMENT**
    To prevent critical errors like `ValueError`, all agents MUST strictly follow these rules:
    1.  **Stateful Objects (Vectorizers, Scalers, etc.):** Any object that is "fitted" on the training data (e.g., `TfidfVectorizer`, `StandardScaler`) **MUST be saved to a file** (e.g., using `pickle`) during the training/feature engineering phase. For the prediction phase on the test data, the agent **MUST load this exact saved object** to transform the new data. **NEVER refit or create a new object on the test data.** This ensures feature consistency.
    2.  **Consistent Preprocessing:** The entire sequence of data cleaning and preprocessing steps (handling missing values, text cleaning, feature creation) applied to the training data **MUST be identically replicated** on the test data before making predictions.
    3.  **Data Validation:** Before performing critical operations, agents should perform sanity checks. For instance, before converting a column's data type, check for unexpected values. Before prediction, ensure the number of features in the test data matches the number of features the model was trained on. This prevents data integrity errors.

    ---
    CRITICAL OUTPUT RULE: To prevent system errors, all code executed via the `execute_code` tool MUST follow this rule:
    - NEVER print raw dataframes (e.g., `print(df)` or `print(df.head())`).
    - Instead, the code's final output MUST be a CONCISE STRING summarizing the findings or results.
    - This rule is mandatory for all agents to ensure stable execution.

    task: Binary Classification
    target_column: label
    objective: >
    Build a model to classify news articles as fake or real. The target 'label' is 1 for fake and 0 for true.
    
    IMPORTANT STRATEGY: This is a large dataset. To ensure efficiency, please adhere to the following workflow:
    1. First, For all initial analysis steps (Data Exploration, Statistics, Feature Engineering, and Model Selection), all agents MUST use the smaller 'sampled_data.csv'.
    2. For the final model training step, the ModelTraining agent MUST load the FULL 'train.csv' dataset. It should then re-apply the feature engineering steps that were developed on the sample data to the full dataset before training the final model.
    3. After the final model is trained on the full data, use it to predict the labels for the articles in 'test.csv'.
    The final evaluation metric is Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score. You must use the `execute_code` tool to run all your code.
    
    ---

    **DATA LOADING & ERROR HANDLING STRATEGY:**
    - In the first step Data Exploration, you MUST use the 'sampled_dataset.csv' and MUST NOT print the eda summary directly, MUST NOT use `info_buffer = StringIO()` to capture output, MUST NOT use function. Instead, you Just Only need to save the EDA report to a file named `eda_report.txt` in the working directory and output a concise summary string.
    - **This is a critical, mandatory instruction:** When the `ModelTraining` agent loads the full `train.csv` file, it **MUST ALWAYS, BY DEFAULT**, include the `on_bad_lines='skip'` parameter in the `pd.read_csv` command.
    - **Reasoning:** The full `train.csv` dataset is known to contain malformed rows. Using `on_bad_lines='skip'` from the start is a required step to prevent predictable parsing errors, not a fallback option.
    - when using the full `train.csv` dataset, the agent must still use `encoding='utf-8'` and `sep='	'`.
    ---

    **DATA CLEANSING & VALIDATION STRATEGY:**
    - **This is a mandatory data integrity check:** The raw `train.csv` is known to have data quality issues beyond just malformed rows. Specifically, the target column ('label') may contain non-numeric values (e.g., the string 'label' from a misplaced header).
    - **CRITICAL ACTION:** To prevent `ValueError` during data type conversion, the `ModelTraining` agent **MUST** perform the following cleansing sequence immediately after loading the full `train.csv` dataframe:
        1.  First, use `pd.to_numeric` on the 'label' column with the `errors='coerce'` parameter. This will safely convert all valid numbers and turn any invalid strings into `NaN` (Not a Number).
        2.  Second, immediately chain a `.dropna()` call on the dataframe for the subset of the 'label' column to permanently remove these corrupted rows.
        3.  Only after completing these two steps should the agent proceed to convert the 'label' column to `int` and continue with the rest of the workflow.
    - **Example Logic:** `df['label'] = pd.to_numeric(df['label'], errors='coerce')` followed by `df.dropna(subset=['label'], inplace=True)`
    
    ---
    
    **MLOps PRINCIPLE: PIPELINE CONSISTENCY & STATE MANAGEMENT**
    To prevent critical errors like `ValueError`, all agents MUST strictly follow these rules:
    1.  **Stateful Objects (Vectorizers, Scalers, etc.):** Any object that is "fitted" on the training data (e.g., `TfidfVectorizer`, `StandardScaler`) **MUST be saved to a file** (e.g., using `pickle`) during the training/feature engineering phase. For the prediction phase on the test data, the agent **MUST load this exact saved object** to transform the new data. **NEVER refit or create a new object on the test data.** This ensures feature consistency.
    2.  **Consistent Preprocessing:** The entire sequence of data cleaning and preprocessing steps (handling missing values, text cleaning, feature creation) applied to the training data **MUST be identically replicated** on the test data before making predictions.
    3.  **Data Validation:** Before performing critical operations, agents should perform sanity checks. For instance, before converting a column's data type, check for unexpected values. Before prediction, ensure the number of features in the test data matches the number of features the model was trained on. This prevents data integrity errors.

    ---
    CRITICAL OUTPUT RULE: To prevent system errors, all code executed via the `execute_code` tool MUST follow this rule:
    - NEVER print raw dataframes (e.g., `print(df)` or `print(df.head())`).
    - Instead, the code's final output MUST be a CONCISE STRING summarizing the findings or results.
    - This rule is mandatory for all agents to ensure stable execution.

ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'Singer Aaron Carter, who has previously been forthcoming about his substance abuse and eating disorder, is now opening up about his sexuality.  The 29-year-old brother of Backstreet Boys alum Nick Carter tweeted on Saturday night a long open letter in which he acknowledges his attraction to both men and women since he was 13.  "There�s something I�d like to say that I feel is important for myself and my identity that has been weighing on my chest for nearly half of my life," he wrote. "This doesn�t bring me shame, just a weight and burden I have held onto for a long time that I would like lifted off me."  He explains, "I grew up in this entertainment industry at a very young age and when I was around 13 years old I started to find boys and girls attractive."  He then reveals, "There were years that went by that I thought about, but it wasn�t until I was 17 years old, after a few relationships with girls, I had an experience with a male that I had an attraction to who I also worked with and grew up with."  Carter continues, "To me music has always been my temple. Music will ALWAYS be what transcends us and myself. The studio has always been my safe haven. But the ultimate goal for me is to be satisfied. I never want to be a figure of disappointment."  A Tampa, Florida, native, he ends the letter with a quote from singer Boy George, who also has been open in discussing his sexuality.  "The best quote to sum \'I\'ve never felt as though I didn\'t belong, I just acted as though I did.\' � Boy George"  Carter\'s tweet follows his July 15 arrest in Georgia on suspicion of driving under the influence and marijuana possession. His girlfriend, Madison Parker, was in the passenger seat of the car and was also taken into police custody. Carter was released after posting bail for $4,610.'
