# Prediction Report

## Prediction Process Summary

The prediction process was attempted using the trained Random Forest model (`trained_classification_model.pkl`) on the transformed test data (`test_transformed.csv`).

### Steps Taken:
1.  Loaded the transformed test data (`test_transformed.csv`).
2.  Attempted to load the trained model (`trained_classification_model.pkl`).
3.  The model loading failed with a `_pickle.UnpicklingError: STACK_GLOBAL requires str`.

### Issue Encountered:
The trained model could not be loaded due to a deserialization error. This is likely due to an environment incompatibility between the model training and prediction steps.

### Next Steps:
The issue needs to be escalated to the `Planner` to decide on the next course of action. It's recommended to retrain the model in the current environment to ensure compatibility.
