# Prediction Report

The prediction process on the `heart_test.csv` dataset has been successfully completed using the trained XGBoost model. Below are the key details of the process:

## Data Preparation
- **Data Source**: The test data was loaded from `heart_test.csv`.
- **Feature Engineering**: Applied the same transformations as the training data:
  - One-Hot Encoding was applied to categorical columns: 'Sex', 'ChestPainType', 'RestingECG', 'ExerciseAngina', and 'ST_Slope'.
  - Numerical features were standardized: 'Age', 'RestingBP', 'Cholesterol', 'MaxHR', and 'Oldpeak'.
  - Created an interaction feature 'Age_x_Cholesterol'.
- **Column Alignment**: Ensured that all columns in the test data matched those in the training data, filling any missing columns with zeros.

## Model and Prediction
- **Model Used**: Trained XGBoost model (`trained_xgboost_model.pkl`).
- **Prediction Output**: Predictions were generated for the presence of heart disease ('HeartDisease' = 1) and absence ('HeartDisease' = 0).

## Results
- The predictions have been saved to `predictions.csv`, which includes a new column 'Predicted_HeartDisease' alongside the original test data.

## Notes
- The prediction process was executed without errors.
- The transformed test data was aligned with the feature set used during model training to ensure consistency in predictions.

This concludes the prediction phase. The next step is to review the predictions and integrate them into the final analysis and reporting.
