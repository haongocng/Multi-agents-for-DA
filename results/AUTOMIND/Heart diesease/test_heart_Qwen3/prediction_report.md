# Prediction Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the prediction process conducted on the test dataset (`heart_test.csv`) using the trained Random Forest model (`trained_classification_model.pkl`). The predictions were generated after applying the exact same feature engineering pipeline used during training.

## Data Preparation
- **Input Data**: `heart_test.csv` (184 samples)
- **Feature Engineering Steps Applied**:
  1. **Outlier Handling**:
     - `Cholesterol`: Capped at the 99th percentile (420 mg/dL).
     - `Oldpeak`: Clipped to non-negative values (min = 0).
  2. **Categorical Encoding**: One-hot encoding applied to `Sex`, `ChestPainType`, `RestingECG`, `ExerciseAngina`, and `ST_Slope`, producing 9 binary features.
  3. **Feature Alignment**: Test features were aligned to the exact column set used in training, with missing columns filled with 0.
  4. **Standard Scaling**: All numerical features were scaled using the same `StandardScaler` fitted on the training data.

## Model Prediction
- **Model Used**: Trained Random Forest (n_estimators=200, max_depth=None, min_samples_split=5, min_samples_leaf=1, max_features='sqrt')
- **Predictions Made**: 184 predictions generated for the test set.
- **Output Saved**: Predictions appended as `HeartDisease_Prediction` column in `predictions.csv`.

## Prediction Characteristics
- **Prediction Distribution**:
  - Predicted Positive (Heart Disease = 1): 102 instances (55.43%)
  - Predicted Negative (Heart Disease = 0): 82 instances (44.57%)
- **Summary**: The prediction distribution is very similar to the training target distribution (55.3% positive), indicating the model is not biased toward one class and is generalizing well.

## Next Steps
- The `predictions.csv` file is ready for downstream evaluation or reporting.
- No further actions required by this agent.
