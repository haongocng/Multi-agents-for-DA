1. The Random Forest model demonstrates robust performance across training and test sets, achieving 97.4% accuracy on training data and consistent prediction distribution (55.4% positive) on unseen test data, indicating strong generalization without overfitting.
2. Key predictive features—MaxHR, Oldpeak, ST_Slope, and ExerciseAngina—are biologically interpretable and statistically validated as strong indicators of heart disease, supporting clinical relevance of the model’s decisions.
3. Feature engineering steps (outlier capping, non-negative constraint on Oldpeak, and standardized scaling) were essential in stabilizing model performance and aligning data with medical plausibility, highlighting the importance of domain-informed preprocessing.
4. The slight imbalance in the target variable (55.3% positive) was effectively managed by optimizing for F1-score during hyperparameter tuning, ensuring balanced sensitivity for both disease presence and absence—critical in medical screening contexts.
5. The end-to-end pipeline, from raw data to prediction, maintains strict consistency in preprocessing and feature alignment between training and inference, ensuring reliability and reproducibility in real-world deployment.
