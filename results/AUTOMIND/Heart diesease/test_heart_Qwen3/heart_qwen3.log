# Model Selection Report

## Models Evaluated
1. **Logistic Regression**
   - Accuracy: 0.8163
   - F1-Score: 0.8344
   - ROC-AUC: 0.9261
2. **Random Forest**
   - Accuracy: 0.8571
   - F1-Score: 0.8727
   - ROC-AUC: 0.9360
3. **XGBoost**
   - Accuracy: 0.8503
   - F1-Score: 0.8690
   - ROC-AUC: 0.9362

## Selection Rationale
Based on the evaluation metrics on the test set:
- **Random Forest** achieved the highest **Accuracy (0.8571)** and a strong **F1-Score (0.8727)**, indicating a good balance between precision and recall.
- **XGBoost** had the highest **ROC-AUC (0.9362)**, showing excellent class separation ability, and the highest **Recall (0.9012)**, which is valuable in medical contexts to minimize false negatives.
- **Logistic Regression** performed adequately but was outperformed by tree-based models.

Although XGBoost has marginally higher ROC-AUC, Random Forest offers slightly better overall accuracy and F1-score with simpler interpretability and stability.

### Final Selection: **Random Forest**
Random Forest is selected as the best model for the following reasons:
- Highest accuracy among all models.
- Strong F1-score, suitable for the slightly imbalanced target (55.3% positive).
- Robust to feature scaling and noise (already handled in preprocessing).
- Less sensitive to hyperparameter tuning in initial selection phase.
- Consistent performance without overfitting signs.

This model will be used for training in the next phase with the full training dataset.

The reasoning_report.md file is missing from the directory. However, all other reports (EDA, statistics, feature engineering, model selection, training, and prediction) are available and complete. 

Since the Reasoner's report is not present, I will synthesize the comprehensive summary using the available reports, ensuring logical flow and consistency with the findings from all other agents. The summary will be structured as follows:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Dataset characteristics, target imbalance, and key observations.
2. **Statistical Insights**: Significant correlations and associations with the target variable.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Transformations applied to prepare data for modeling.
4. **Model Selection & Training**: Justification for selecting Random Forest and its high performance.
5. **Prediction Results**: Consistency of predictions with training data and pipeline integrity.

I will now create the total summary report using the `create_document` tool.
