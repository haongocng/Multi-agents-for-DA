1. The final classification model for predicting willingness to share digital skills is a tuned Random Forest with an overall accuracy of 83.91%.
2. The model performs exceptionally well for classes 4 and 5 (high precision and recall), which correspond to strong willingness to share, indicating it is effective at identifying highly engaged students.
3. Class 1 (low willingness) also has high recall (1.00), meaning the model rarely misses students who are unwilling to share, but precision is lower, suggesting some false positives.
4. Classes 2 and 3 (moderate willingness) show the weakest performance, particularly in recall (50% and 53%), indicating the model struggles to correctly classify students in the middle range.
5. This suggests that willingness to share digital skills is easier to predict at the extremes (very willing or not willing) than in the middle, possibly due to more nuanced attitudes or correlated features.
6. The model is suitable for identifying highly engaged students or those who need targeted interventions, but may require further refinement to better capture mid-range responses.
