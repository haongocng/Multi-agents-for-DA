1. The dataset 'edudata_english.csv' contains 1305 rows and 23 columns.

3. The dataset includes timestamps and various responses related to digital skills, confidence, and willingness to share.
4. There are no explicit missing values detected in the target variable, but some features may have missing or non-numerical entries.
5. The target variable distribution is skewed towards higher values (mostly 5 and 4), indicating a general willingness to share digital skills.
6. Next steps: Perform feature engineering, handle data types, encode categorical variables, and prepare for classification modeling.
