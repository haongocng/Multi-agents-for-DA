1. Three classification models were evaluated: Logistic Regression (accuracy: 0.8199), Random Forest (accuracy: 0.8506), and Gradient Boosting (accuracy: 0.8391).

2. Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy on the test set and was selected as the best-performing model for further tuning.

3. The dataset is imbalanced in favor of higher target values (4 and 5), but stratified splitting was used to ensure proper representation.

4. Feature engineering successfully transformed 22 original features into 797 features after one-hot encoding and standardization.

Outline saved to storage\final_insights_report.mdFINAL ANSWER: The classification analysis on the 'edudata_english.csv' dataset to predict willingness to share digital skills has been completed. The best-performing model is a tuned Random Forest classifier with the following final evaluation metrics:     

- **Accuracy**: 83.91%
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score by Class**:        
  - Class 1 (Low Willingness): Precision=0.80, Recall=1.00, F1=0.89
  - Class 2 (Moderate): Precision=0.75, Recall=0.50, F1=0.60
  - Class 3 (Moderate): Precision=0.85, Recall=0.53, F1=0.65
  - Class 4 (High Willingness): Precision=0.76, Recall=0.81, F1=0.78
  - Class 5 (Very High Willingness): Precision=0.88, Recall=0.93, F1=0.91

The model excels at identifying students with very high (Class 5) or very low (Class 1) willingness to share digital skills. Performance is weaker for moderate willingness levels (Classes 2 and 3), suggesting these responses may reflect more complex or ambiguous attitudes. The final model and evaluation reports are saved as `trained_model.pkl`, `model_evaluation_report.md`, and `final_insights_report.md`.
