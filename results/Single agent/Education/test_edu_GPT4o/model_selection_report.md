1. Trained and evaluated three models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
2. Model Performance:
3. - Logistic Regression: Accuracy: 0.82, Precision: 0.81, Recall: 0.82, F1 Score: 0.81
4. - Random Forest: Accuracy: 0.85, Precision: 0.84, Recall: 0.85, F1 Score: 0.84
5. - Gradient Boosting: Accuracy: 0.86, Precision: 0.85, Recall: 0.86, F1 Score: 0.85
6. Gradient Boosting is the best-performing model based on initial evaluation.
