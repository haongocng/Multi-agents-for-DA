1. ## Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Perform initial data analysis to understand the structure and types of data in heart_train.csv and heart_test.csv.
3. ## Step 2: Feature Engineering
4. Preprocess data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical variables.
5. ## Step 3: Model Selection
6. Train and evaluate at least three different classification models to find the best-performing model type for predicting heart disease.
7. ## Step 4: Model Training
8. Perform hyperparameter tuning on the best model from Step 3 to optimize its performance.
9. ## Step 5: Evaluation
10. Evaluate the final trained model on heart_test.csv and calculate the required metrics: Accuracy, Precision (Class 0), Recall (Class 0), F1-Score (Class 0), Precision (Class 1), Recall (Class 1), F1-Score (Class 1).
