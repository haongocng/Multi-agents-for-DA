1. - Three classification models were trained and evaluated: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
2. - Evaluation was performed on a 20% validation split of the training data.
3. - Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy (85.71%) and best overall F1-scores for both classes.
4. - Gradient Boosting performed second best with 83.67% accuracy.
5. - Logistic Regression had the lowest performance at 78.91% accuracy.
6. - Random Forest showed the highest recall for Class 1 (90.12%), indicating strong detection of heart disease cases.
7. - Based on performance, Random Forest was selected as the best model for hyperparameter tuning.
