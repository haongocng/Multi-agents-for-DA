1. - The trained Random Forest model was loaded and used to make predictions on the test set ('heart_test.csv').
2. - Test data was preprocessed identically to the training data: Cholesterol 0s were replaced with np.nan, categorical variables were label-encoded using consistent mappings, missing values were imputed with median, and numerical features were standardized.
3. - Predictions for heart disease presence (1) or absence (0) were generated for all 184 test samples.
4. - Predictions were saved to 'predictions.csv' for submission or further analysis.
5. - The model is now ready for deployment and evaluation using the specified metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score for both classes), which can be computed if the true labels for the test set become available.
