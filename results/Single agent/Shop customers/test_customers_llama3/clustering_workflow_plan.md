1. Step 1: Read the Customers.csv file using the collect_data function to load the data into a pandas DataFrame.
2. Step 2: Use the read_document function to create a report of the initial findings.
3. Step 3: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the loaded data to understand the distribution of Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.
4. Step 4: Use the execute_code function to perform K-Means clustering on the preprocessed data and determine the optimal number of clusters.
5. Step 5: Create visualizations of the clusters using PCA for 2D plotting and save the plots as image files.
6. Step 6: Analyze the characteristics of each cluster and create a final insights report detailing the key attributes of each customer segment.
