2. Based on the output from the Python code, we can see that our dataset contains 2000 entries across 8 categories: CustomerID, Gender, Age, Annual Income, Spending Score, Profession, Work Experience, and Family Size.
3. The dataset does not contain any missing values for CustomerID, Age, Annual Income, Spending Score, Work Experience, and Family Size, but it does have some missing values for the Profession column.
4. From the summary statistics, we can observe that the average Age is around 49 years, the mean Annual Income is approximately $52,000, the average Spending Score is close to 49, Work Experience averages about 4.1 years, and Family Size averages 3.77 members.
