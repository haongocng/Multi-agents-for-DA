1. Selected numerical features for clustering: Age, Annual Income ($), Spending Score (1-100).
2. Categorical features (Gender, Profession) were excluded from clustering input but will be used later for cluster profiling.
3. Transformed dataset with only the three numerical features has been saved as 'transformed_data.csv'.
4. No missing values were present, so no imputation was needed.
5. No scaling was applied yet â€” this will be done before clustering since algorithms like K-Means are sensitive to feature scales.
