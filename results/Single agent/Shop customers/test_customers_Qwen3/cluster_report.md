1. K-Means clustering was applied with k=5 clusters based on the elbow method.
2. PCA was used to reduce the 3D feature space to 2D for visualization.
3. A scatter plot of the clusters was generated and saved as 'cluster_pca_plot.png'.
4. Cluster labels were appended to the original dataset and saved as 'Customers_with_clusters.csv' for profiling.
5. Cluster centroids in scaled space were computed and will be used to interpret cluster characteristics.
