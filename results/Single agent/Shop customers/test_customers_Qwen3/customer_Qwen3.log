2. Target features for clustering: Age, Annual Income ($), Spending Score (1-100) - these are numerical and most relevant for segmentation.

3. Categorical features (Gender, Profession) may be useful for profiling clusters post-clustering but not for the distance-based clustering algorithm itself. 

4. No missing values detected in the dataset.

1. Features were scaled using StandardScaler to ensure equal weighting in K-Means clustering.

2. Elbow method was applied with k ranging from 1 to 10 to determine optimal number of clusters.

3. The inertia values decreased as k increased, with a clear elbow point observed at k=5 — indicating that 5 clusters balance model complexity and explained variance.

4. The scaled dataset has been saved as 'X_scaled.csv' for use in clustering.

5. Elbow plot was saved as 'elbow_method.png' for visual reference.
