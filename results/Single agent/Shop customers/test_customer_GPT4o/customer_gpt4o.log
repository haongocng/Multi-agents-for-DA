Invoking: `collect_data` with `{'data_path': 'Customers.csv'}`
responded: To achieve the objective of segmenting customers into distinct groups based on their characteristics, I will follow a structured clustering workflow. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. **Step 1: EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**
   - Load the dataset and examine its structure.
   - Understand the data types, check for missing values, and summarize key statistics.
   - Visualize the distribution of key features like Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.

2. **Step 2: Feature Engineering**
   - Preprocess the data by handling missing values if any.
   - Scale numerical features to ensure they contribute equally to the distance calculations in clustering.

3. **Step 3: Clustering**
   - Apply a clustering algorithm (e.g., K-Means) to segment the customers.
   - Determine the optimal number of clusters using methods like the Elbow method.

4. **Step 4: Visualization**
   - Create visualizations of the clusters using techniques like PCA for 2D plotting to inspect the clusters visually.

5. **Step 5: Cluster Profiling & Final Insights**
   - Analyze the characteristics of each cluster to understand what makes each group distinct.
   - Provide a detailed profile for each customer segment, describing their key attributes.

I will start with Step 1: EDA. Let's load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis.
