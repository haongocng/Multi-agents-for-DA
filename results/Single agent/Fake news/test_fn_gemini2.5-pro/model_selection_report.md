1. Model Selection on transformed_data.csv
2. Trained and evaluated three classification models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
3. Results:
4.   - Logistic Regression: Accuracy=0.7861, F1-score=0.6695
5.   - Random Forest: Accuracy=0.7722, F1-score=0.6555
6.   - Gradient Boosting: Accuracy=0.7806, F1-score=0.6722
7. Gradient Boosting was selected as the best model for the next step due to its higher F1-score.
