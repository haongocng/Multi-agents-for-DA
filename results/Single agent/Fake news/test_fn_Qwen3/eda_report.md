1. 1. Dataset loaded successfully: 'sampled_dataset.csv' has 1800 rows and 2 columns ('text' and 'label').
2. 2. Target variable 'label' is binary: 1066 real (0) and 733 fake (1) articles. One extra row with label 'label' was identified and removed during inspection but is not present in final data.
3. 3. No missing values detected in text or label columns.
4. 4. Text data contains natural language with punctuation, emojis, and formatting typical of news articles.
5. 5. Class distribution is imbalanced but acceptable for binary classification (59.2% real, 40.8% fake).
6. 6. Next step: Perform feature engineering on the cleaned data (text preprocessing, vectorization, etc.) using the same sample dataset.
