"Three years have passed since Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton divorced, but the superstar of country music is always mending the pieces of his broken heart.  In the second part of her interview with Holly Gleason of HITS Daily Double, which was published on Tuesday, Lambert reveals why she avoided the press leading up to her 2016 album, The Weight of These Wings . Lambert detailed his separation from Shelton in the deeply personal project, which went platinum and won the album of the year at the awards of ACM 2017.  Of his decision to make the 39 Deadlock on a promotional tour, Lambert shared: ""It was going to be hell, and I had already gone through hell, it was hell to put it on paper, put my words on the paper.  ""I finally arrived at a place where I was no longer sad,"" she continued. ""All the moments of sadness were there, all the truths were right in these songs, it was enough to listen, I did not need to say anything.",0   

"Stormi Webster already knows how to be the life of the party!  The entire KarJenner clan gathered at the glamorous Polo Lounge at The Beverly Hills Hotel on Thursday to celebrate Kris Jenner’s mom Mary Jo “MJ” Shannon’s 84th birthday. During the bash, Kris got to spend some quality time with Kylie Jenner’s 5-month-old baby Stormi.  In a video posted to Snapchat, Kris can be seen sweetly rocking her granddaughter, whose hair is still styled in the adorable ponytail Kylie debuted last week, and caressing her cheeks.  Aunt Kendall Jenner, 22, was also spotted holding Stormi in a different clip with Kourtney Kardashian, 39, and her 6-year-old daughter Penelope Disick.  Kris Jenner woth Stormi Instagram  Want all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs? Click here to get those and more in the PEOPLE Babies newsletter.  Of course, MJ did, however, receive a lot of love on her special day. Kim Kardashian, who was also at the party with her daughter North West, shared a throwback photo of herself as a child with MJ.  “Happy 84th Birthday to my main idol, my grandma MJ! My grandma is the strongest person I know,” Kim captioned the Instagram post.  Kendall Jenner and Stormi  “I saw her be the provider of her family and run her own clothing store my whole life, she’s battled cancer and beat it twice, and she always gives me the realest best advice!”  “She’s probably the only person on this planet that I still remember their home number by heart lol My grandma has a finsta so everyone leave nice comments wishing her a happy birthday,” Kim added.

"Rumors of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West getting a divorce are highly exaggerated. The superstar couple are still married.  According to Gossip Cop, OK! Australia recently published an issue with the headline ""Kim & Kanye: It’s Finally Over! Divorce Papers Signed!"" The cover even showed documents, claiming they proved the divorce. But one never happened.  In fact, the documents on the cover are actually from Kardashian's 2004 divorce from her first husband, Damon Thomas. They are in the public record, so the documents can be easily obtained on the web.  The content in the report is exactly the same as what appeared in In Touch Weekly.That issue included a supposed quote from Kardashian, ""Kanye's not the man I fell in love with."" The cover also claimed West broke down in tears and Kardashian took their three children to live with her mother, Kris Jenner.  At the time the two reports were published, both OK! Australia and In Touch were owned by the same company, Bauer Media. As of July 1, In Touch is owned by American Media Inc., the publisher of Us Weekly, Radar Online and the National Enquirer.  In Touch claimed that Kardashian was pushed ""over the edge"" after they went to Paris in June. A source told the magazine Kardashian was upset after seeing West hug Virgil Abloh at the Louis Vuitton fashion show. But if Kardashian was upset, she did not show it publicly. In fact, she retweeted a video of the scene, adding a heart emoji.  The trip was emotional for Kardashian, since it marked her first time in Paris since she was robbed there in October 2016.  The tabloid report also claims Kardashian told her family she was leaving West after his infamous remarks about slavery to TMZ and his tweets. In reality, Kardashian publicly supported her husband. Later, West did admit he thought Kardashian would leave him.  ""There was a moment where I felt like after TMZ, maybe a week after that, I felt like the energy levels were low, and I called different family members and was asking, you know, 'Was Kim thinking about leaving me after TMZ?'"" he told The New York Times last month. ""So that was a real conversation.""  West also referred to Kardashian's decision to stick by him in his son ""Wouldn't Leave,"" in which he raps, “Told her she could leave me now/But she wouldn’t leave.”  West and Kardashian have been married since 2014 and share three children, 5-year-old North, 2-year-old Saint and 6-month-old Chicago.

"Washington (CNN) It wouldn't be an awards show without some political moments.  This year, we kept track of every political jab and line made at the 90th annual Academy Awards show . Check out the list below:  On the carpet  Fashion as a political statement  Tonight, actors and allies will #WearOrange pins and ribbons on the #Oscars red carpet to bring awareness to gun violence prevention in the wake of the Parkland school shooting. https://t.co/7BxtM6bTKD  As expected, many attendees sported the signature ""Time's up"" black and white pin.  Another popular pin spotted on the carpet? #WearOrange pins and ribbons from gun control group Everytown. They were worn in an effort to raise awareness about gun safety.  Puerto Rico still on the mind  During an interview with Michael Strahan, ""Hamilton"" creator Lin-Manuel Miranda encouraged viewers to visit Puerto Rico after the devastating hurricane.  Lin-Manuel Miranda encourages viewers to visit Puerto Rico after devastating hurricane: ""Keep Puerto Rico in the conversation...keep Puerto Rico in your hearts."" https://t.co/exBwXimwm1 #Oscars pic.twitter.com/kBxhqLo1UG — ABC News (@ABC) March 5, 2018  ""Keep Puerto Rico in the conversation. I know there's no shortage of things in the news, but keep Puerto Rico in your hearts,"" Miranda said.  He added that tourism is ""the lifeblood"" of Puerto Rico, and urged people to ""spend money there.""  On average, 87% of the island has power, but sources told CNN that about 150,000 US citizens on the island still don't have electricity. Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló has repeatedly expressed frustration at the slow pace of recovery and help. He has questioned the US Army Corps of Engineers' response on the island compared with other states dealing with disaster.  Miranda has been an outspoken critic of the government response to Puerto Rico's needs, and had strong words for President Donald Trump following his criticism of San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz last year.  In October of 2017, Miranda released a song -- with help from 22 other artists -- to raise money for hurricane relief in Puerto Rico.  Political activists attended Hollywood's biggest night  Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards attended the Oscars with Patrisse Cullors-Brignac, one of the co-founders of Black Lives Matter, and Bryan Stevenson, Equal Justice Initiative director. The three posed on the red carpet ahead of the show.  Richards, who announced in January that she is leaving the role later this year, posted a photo on Instagram. ""So the Oscars are cool but being with Bryan and Patrisse is 100,"" she wrote.  Jimmy Kimmel's opener  Kimmel returned to the helm as host on Sunday. He of course had a few envelope jokes, referencing the envelope mix-up last year that initially (and mistakenly) resulted in ""La La Land"" being named the best picture winner over ""Moonlight"" at the 89th Academy Awards.  But there were also a few political zingers.  Wakanda  Before kicking off his monologue, Kimmel did an old Hollywood-like voiceover to black and white footage from this year's red carpet.  ""There's Chadwick Boseman,"" he said at one point, as footage of the ""Black Panther"" actor played. ""The king of Wakanda! Imagine that! A country with a black leader. Wouldn't that be swell?""  Fox News  Later, while talking about Harvey Weinstein -- and the subsequent powerful #MeToo movement and Time's Up initiative -- Kimmel joked about the awards show statuette: Oscar.  ""Oscar is 89 years old this year, which probably means he's at home watching Fox News,"" Kimmel said, a jab at the network news channel's older, more conservative viewers.  He went on to clarify that ""Oscar is a very respected man in Hollywood. Just look at him: He keeps his hands where he can see them, no penis.""  ""Get Out"" and Trump  The first Trump joke came about 10 minutes into Kimmel's monologue.  ""None other than President Trump called 'Get Out' the best 3/4 of a movie so far this year,"" Kimmel said when addressing the mastermind behind the film, Jordan Peele  The horror film, which has received praise for its performances and thought-provoking take on race in America, received four Academy Award nominations, including one for best picture.  Calling out Vice President Mike Pence  Kimmel made a joke about Pence while talking about best actor nominee Timothee Chalamet, nominated for the film ""Call Me By Your Name,"" a gay love story.  ""We don't make films like 'Call Me By Your Name for money,"" Kimmel said, while talking about how the film was critically acclaimed but didn't do as well at the box office. ""We make them to upset Mike Pence.""  Kimmel during the show  Hope Hicks' departure  Kimmel made another White House joke while introducing director Greta Gerwig and actress Laura Dern before they presented the best documentary feature category.  ""If the last two years have taught us anything, it's that reality can be ... depressing,"" he said. ""But tonight's nominated documentaries show us that where there is darkness, there is also hope. Except at the White House. Hope quit on Wednesday.""  Hicks, the former White House communications director and one of Trump's longest-serving and closest aides, resigned last week.  Putin burn  The Russian Olympics doping documentary ""Icarus"" took home best documentary feature on Sunday.  The film, from filmmaker Bryan Fogel, delves into the controversy around performance-enhancing drugs in sports. It follows the eccentric Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, the whistleblower who exposed what a leading report called a doping ""cover-up that operated on an unprecedented scale"" in Russia (read CNN's story on this here ).  Russia was banned from the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics following state-sponsored doping, leading up to and including the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics.  Kimmel's response to ""Icarus"" winning? ""At least we know Putin didn't rig this competition.""  Speaking of 'Icarus' ...  During his acceptance speech, Fogel got a little political himself.  ""We dedicate this award to Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, our fearless whistleblower, who now lives in great danger,"" he said. ""We hope 'Icarus' is a wake-up call -- yes, about Russia, but more importantly, about telling the truth.""  An ad that stood out  We stand with women around the world to make their voices heard and their presence known. To bring them front and center, today and every day. Join us as we say #HereWeArehttps://t.co/bVXGJ1NibP — Twitter (@Twitter) March 5, 2018  Twitter premiered an ad called #HereWeAre during the Oscars with a message empowering women leaders. While the ad was not explicitly political, it included an implicit reference to immigration rhetoric.  ""If this poem is the only thing that survives me, tell them this is how it happened: Tell them I built me a throne. Tell them when we discovered life on another planet it was a woman and she built a bridge -- not a border. I heard that this is how you make history. This is how you create a new world.""  A shout out to the Dreamers  The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program has enabled hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants -- sometimes called Dreamers -- who were brought to the United States as children to come out from the shadows and openly attend school and get work permits and driver's licenses without fear of being deported.  Trump announced the end of the DACA program last fall, giving Congress a March 5 deadline to come up with an alternate solution. But that deadline became moot after two separate district courts ruled that the administration must keep accepting renewal applications for the program, effectively putting the termination on hold.  ""Like everyone in this room and everyone watching at home we are dreamers,"" said Nyong'o, who is from Kenya. ""We grew up dreaming of one day working in the movies. Dreams are the foundation of Hollywood, and dreams are the foundation of America.""  Nanjiani added: ""To all the Dreamers out there, we stand with you.""  Common, Andra Day and activists share stage  Richards, of Planned Parenthood  Cullors, of Black Lives Matter  Alice Brown Otter, of Standing Rock Youth Council  Bana Alabed, author and Syrian refugee  Stevenson, of Equal Justice Initiative  Dolores Huerta, of Dolores Huerta Foundation and United Farm Workers of America  Janet Mock, of #GirlsLikeUs  José Andrés, of ThinkFoodGroup  Nicole Hockley, of Sandy Hook Promise  Tarana Burke, of #MeToo  Common called out the National Rifle Association during his rap.  ""Tell the NRA they ain't God's way and tell the people of Parkland we say àse (a West African philosophy about creating change).,"" the Oscar-winning rapper said, referring to the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, which left 17 people dead last month.  The NRA responded to Common on Twitter. The organization wrote : ""@common @TheAcademy: This is what the #NRA and its members stand for. #Oscars."" The tweet included a video of Dom Raso, a Navy SEAL veteran.  #TimesUp in the spotlight  Ashley Judd, Annabella Sciorra and Salma Hayek praise the #MeToo, #TimesUp movements: ""The changes we are witnessing are being driven by the powerful sound of new voices, of different voices, of our voices."" https://t.co/wst3Hx4GJF #Oscars pic.twitter.com/dBqhimu402 — ABC News (@ABC) March 5, 2018  Ashley Judd, Annabella Sciorra and Salma Hayek -- three of Harvey Weinstein's accusers -- also shared an emotional moment onstage, before introducing a video that featured many of the Oscar nominees and others in the industry talking about the importance of diversity in Hollywood.  ""The changes we are witnessing are being driven by the powerful sound of new voices, different voices, of our voices, who are joining together in a mighty chorus that is finally saying Time's Up,"" Judd said.  The video featured interviews with Nanjiani, Ava Duvernay, Greta Gerwig, Barry Jenkins and others.  ""Some of my favorite movies are by straight white dudes, about straight white dudes,"" Nanjiani says in the video. ""Now you can watch my movies and relate to me. It's not that hard. I've been doing it my whole life.""  Guillermo del Toro 'erases lines in the sand'  Mexican filmmaker del Toro won best director on Sunday for ""The Shape of Water,"" making him the third director from Mexico to win the category. Alfonso Cuarón won for ""Gravity"" in 2014 and Alejandro González Iñárritu won for ""Birdman"" in 2015 and ""The Revenant"" in 2016.  ""I am an immigrant,"" del Toro said in his speech. ""In the last 25 years, I've been living in a country all of our own. The greatest thing our industry does is to erase lines in the sand. We should continue to do that.""  ""The Shape of Water"" also won the biggest award of the night -- best picture -- to bring its total statuettes to four.",1

"The next 48 hours leading up to the cast announcement are likely to be pretty hectic, so I thought I better get this posted sooner rather than later. Here’s the list of all the cast rumors we’ve heard/reported on for season 24 – as always, they’re divided into categories. Legitimate possibilities are rumors that we think have some validity, based on who is reporting them; long shots are rumors from a source that we don’t necessarily trust, but it’s possible they could be valid; pure randomness is general observations/weird stuff we’ve noticed that may or may not indicate anything, but is interesting nonetheless; wannabes/campaigners are celebs that have expressed interest in doing the show, but we have no reason to believe they’ve actually been asked to do the show; and the definite “no’s” are celebs that have specifically said they won’t do the show.  If anything new crops up between now & the announcement, I’ll do my best to update…but no guarantees. Tomorrow is Fat Tuesday, and I’ve got hella king cakes to get ready 😎  Legitimate possibilities :  Normani Kordei  Simone Biles  Mr. T  Chris Kattan  Erika Jayne  Nancy Kerrigan  Nick Viall  Heather Morris  Charo  Bonner Bolton  Rashad Jennings  Longshots :  Someone from Pretty Little Liars/Ashley Benson  Someone from Property Brothers/Jonathan Scott  Someone from Storage Wars/Barry Weiss  Rachel Lindsay  Russell Brand  Usher  Billy Bush  Pure Randomness :  Shemar Moore  Victor Cruz  Gracie Gold  Ricky Schroeder  Jose Medina  Wannabes/Campaigners :  Mary Lou Retton  Stassi Schroeder  Dina Parise  The Definite No’s :  Hugh Grant  Ashlee Simpson  Michelle Obama  Hillary Clinton",1

"Terry Crews arrives at an event in Beverly Hills, Calif., in November 2017. (Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP)  Last October, as the #MeToo earthquake was beginning to rip through the Hollywood power structure following abuse allegations connected to producer Harvey Weinstein, actor Terry Crews significantly readjusted the national conversation.  In tweets, the “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” star laid out his own claims of experiencing sexual harassment. At a party in 2016, a “high-level Hollywood executive” came up to Crews and “groped my privates,” the actor wrote. Crews later publicly identified the executive as Adam Venit, a longtime industry power-player who represented marquee names such as Adam Sandler, Sylvester Stallone, Eddie Murphy and Vince Vaughn. Crews went on to file a police report about the incident, as well as a lawsuit against Venit and his agency, William Morris Endeavor.  But Crews’s revelation reverberated well beyond his own case. His public stand detonated stereotypes by showing a 240-pound former NFL player could also be the victim of sexual assault, thus widening the lens of the #MeToo movement. Time included Crews among the “the silence breakers” named in the magazine’s person of the year feature.  Now, Crews’s legal case has come to an end. On Thursday, William Morris Endeavor announced the lawsuit has been settled.  “Terry Crews, Adam Venit and WME have settled the lawsuit Mr. Crews filed last year,” the agency said in a statement, according to the Hollywood Reporter. “It will be dismissed.”  According to Deadline, Venit is also planning to retire from WME on Monday. He had previously been suspended and demoted following Crews’s allegation.  After news of the settlement and Venit’s exit, Crews responded on Twitter with a single word: “ACCOUNTABILITY,” he wrote.  That was the theme Crews has continually hit on since speaking out.  “People need to be held accountable,” the actor told “Good Morning America” last November. “This is the deal about Hollywood. It is an abuse of power. This guy, again, he’s one of the most powerful [men] in Hollywood, and he looked at me at the end as if, ‘Who is going to believe you?’”  “The assault lasted only minutes, but what he was effectively telling me while he held my genitals in his hand was that he held the power. That he was in control,” Crews told the Senate Judiciary Committee this summer. “As I shared my story, I was told over and over that this was not abuse. This was just a joke. This was just horseplay. But I can say one man’s horseplay is another man’s humiliation.”  In his lawsuit, filed last December, Crews recounted his alleged encounter with the star agent. “Venit, upon his first meeting Crews, viciously grabbed Crews’s penis and testicles so hard that it caused Crews immediate pain in a blatant and unprovoked sexual assault,” the lawsuit stated.  Crews, who was not Venit’s client, reportedly told his own WME agent about the assault the next day. But the agency did nothing, his lawsuit claimed, as part of “corporate culture that fosters environments in which WME agents are knowingly permitted and encouraged to engage in misconduct, including sexually predatory conduct.”  In court filings, Venit denied the allegations, the Associated Press reported.  According to the Reporter, a criminal investigation into the assault spearheaded by the Los Angeles Police Department commenced last November. In March, the prosecutors announced they were declining criminal charges because of “the lapse in statute of limitations for misdemeanor cases.”  But the allegations also triggered an internal review at WME. The Reporter wrote that the agency’s internal review determined that Crews’s allegation about Venit was “indicative of a pattern, rather than an isolated event.” The agent was bumped down from his position as the head of the agency’s motion picture group.  Venit’s demotion — and now exit — from the industry represented a significant nose dive for a man who was a considerable force within Hollywood for more than three decades. According to Deadline, the agent started out working in the mailroom at Creative Artists Agency in 1986 after dropping out of law school. He later went on to represent some of the biggest movie stars in the business.",0

"The accolades just kept coming after the release of 2002’s The Hours, in which Kidman plays famed writer Virginia Woolf. She picked up her second Golden Globe, a SAG Award and yes, an Oscar, for the performance. In 2015, Kidman said that though this was a professionally rewarding time, she was lonely. “Out of my divorce came work that was applauded so that was an interesting thing for me,” she said at the 2015 Women in the World conference. “That culminated in winning an Oscar and that caused an epiphany which was, ‘This isn’t the answer.’ I was holding a gold statue and I was the loneliest I’d ever been.”",0
