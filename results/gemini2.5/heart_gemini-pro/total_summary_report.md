1. # Total Summary Report
2. ## 1. Introduction
3. This report summarizes the entire workflow for the heart disease prediction task, from initial data analysis to model training and prediction.
4. ## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. The dataset contains 734 rows and 12 columns. There are no missing values. The target variable, `HeartDisease`, is slightly imbalanced, with 55% of instances indicating the presence of heart disease.
6. ## 3. Statistical Analysis
7. Correlation analysis revealed that 'Age', 'FastingBS', and 'Oldpeak' have a positive correlation with heart disease, while 'MaxHR' and 'Cholesterol' have a negative correlation. A t-test confirmed a significant difference in the mean age between patients with and without heart disease.
8. ## 4. Feature Engineering
9. Categorical features were one-hot encoded, and numerical features were scaled using `StandardScaler`.
10. ## 5. Model Selection
11. Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers were evaluated. The Random Forest model was selected for its superior accuracy (0.8639) and F1-score (0.8795).
12. ## 6. Model Training
13. The selected Random Forest model was trained with hyperparameter tuning, achieving a final accuracy of 0.9128 on the training data.
14. ## 7. Prediction
15. An error was encountered during the prediction phase. The trained model (`trained_classification_model.pkl`) could not be loaded due to a `_pickle.UnpicklingError`. This suggests a potential environment incompatibility between the training and prediction steps, which prevented the final evaluation on the test set.
