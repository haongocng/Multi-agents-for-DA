1. # Reasoning Report

This report provides answers to the questions formulated in the `hypothesis_report.md`, based on the analysis of the customer dataset.

### 1. Is there a correlation between age and spending score within each cluster?

There is no simple linear correlation between age and spending score across all customer segments. The relationship is more complex and varies by cluster:
- **High-Spending Clusters:** We observe both younger customers (Cluster 2) and older customers (from a wide age range, as seen in the 'Target' or 'Ideal' customer group - Cluster 3) exhibiting high spending scores.
- **Low-Spending Clusters:** Similarly, both younger and older customers can have low spending scores.

This indicates that age alone is not a reliable predictor of spending score. Other factors, such as income and lifestyle (which we can infer from the combination of features), play a more significant role.

### 2. Do customers with higher annual incomes tend to have higher or lower spending scores?

The overall correlation between annual income and spending score is very weak, but the cluster analysis reveals distinct patterns:

- **High Income, High Spending Score (Cluster 3 - 'Target Customers'):** This group represents the ideal customer segment, with both the financial capacity and the willingness to spend.
- **High Income, Low Spending Score (Cluster 0 - 'Careful/Rich Customers'):** These customers have high incomes but are conservative with their spending.
- **Low Income, High Spending Score (Cluster 2 - 'Careless Spenders'):** This segment has a high spending score despite a low annual income, suggesting they may be prone to impulse buying or are less financially cautious.
- **Low Income, Low Spending Score (Cluster 1 - 'Sensible Customers'):** This group has low income and spends accordingly.

Therefore, a high income does not automatically translate to a high spending score.

### 3. Are there distinct purchasing behaviors associated with each customer segment?

Yes, the clustering analysis successfully identified five distinct customer segments with different purchasing behaviors:

- **Cluster 0: The Careful Rich:** High annual income, but low spending score. They are financially well-off but cautious with their money.
- **Cluster 1: The Sensible:** Low annual income and low spending score. They are likely budget-conscious and spend according to their means.
- **Cluster 2: The Careless Spender:** Low annual income but a high spending score. This group may be younger, less financially responsible, or prioritize spending on certain items.
- **Cluster 3: The Target/Ideal Customer:** High annual income and a high spending score. This is the most commercially attractive segment.
- **Cluster 4: The Average Customer:** Mid-range annual income and spending score. This group represents the 'average' customer in the dataset.

### 4. What is the gender distribution within each cluster, and does it influence spending habits?

The available data and reports do not provide information on the gender distribution within each cluster. The clustering was performed based on 'Age', 'Annual Income', and 'Spending Score'. The 'Gender' variable was not included in the clustering model. Therefore, we cannot determine if there is a significant difference in gender distribution across clusters or if gender influences spending habits within these specific segments based on the current analysis.
