1. ## Statistical Analysis Report
2. ### 1. Introduction
3. This report details the statistical analysis of the `train.csv` dataset, focusing on the target variable, `label`.
4. ### 2. Data Preparation
5. The dataset was loaded, and the anomalous row where `label` was 'label' was removed, as identified in the EDA report.
6. ### 3. Distribution of the Target Variable (`label`)
7. After cleaning, the distribution of the `label` column is as follows:
8. - **0 (True News):** 2972 occurrences
9. - **1 (Fake News):** 2014 occurrences
10. ### 4. Statistical Testing
11. - **Chi-squared Test:** A chi-squared test was performed on the `label` column to assess the distribution of the news categories. The test yielded a p-value of 1.0, indicating no significant difference from the observed distribution, which is expected as this test is more meaningful when comparing with another variable.
12. ### 5. Summary
13. The primary statistical observation is the imbalance in the class distribution of the target variable, with a higher number of 'True News' instances. This imbalance should be considered during model training, as it might bias the model towards the majority class.
