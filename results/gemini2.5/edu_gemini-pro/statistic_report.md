6. ## Interpretation
7. The target variable, "I am willing to share my digital skills with other students", shows strong positive correlations with the following features:
8. * "I am willing to introduce digital tools used in learning to other students" (0.84)
9. * "I support the implementation of digital transformation in teaching and learning language majors" (0.80)
10. * "I am willing to learn additional digital skills to improve the quality of my learning" (0.76)
11. These high correlations suggest that students who are willing to share their digital skills are also more likely to be proactive in learning and advocating for digital tools in their education. This insight is valuable for feature selection in the subsequent modeling steps.
