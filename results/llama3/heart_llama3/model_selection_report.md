1. The overall objective is to build a model that accurately predicts heart disease based on the provided dataset.
2. Based on the feature engineering report, we selected the top features for the model selection process.
3. We compared the performance of Random Forest and XGBoost models on the training data.
4. The Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of 0.8571 and an F1-score of 0.8727.
5. The XGBoost model achieved an accuracy of 0.8503 and an F1-score of 0.8675.
6. Considering the performance metrics and data characteristics, we recommend using the Random Forest model for this task.
