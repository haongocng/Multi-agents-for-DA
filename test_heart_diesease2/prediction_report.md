1. # Prediction Report
2. 
3. ## Overview
4. Predictions were generated for the heart disease classification task using the trained XGBoost model on the `heart_test.csv` dataset.
5. 
6. ## Data Preparation
7. - The test dataset (`heart_test.csv`) was preprocessed identically to the training data:
8. - Cholesterol values of 0 were replaced with the median (240.0).
9. - Categorical variables were one-hot encoded using the same categories as in training (dropping first category).
10. - Numerical features were standardized using StandardScaler.
11. - Two engineered features were created: `Age_MaxHR` and `Oldpeak_MaxHR_Ratio`.
12. - Feature names and order were aligned exactly with those used during training.
13. 
14. ## Model Prediction
15. - The trained XGBoost model (`trained_classification_model.pkl`) was loaded and used to predict heart disease presence.
16. - Predictions were made on 184 test samples.
17. 
18. ## Prediction Results
19. - Total predictions: 184
20. - Class distribution:
21.   - No Heart Disease (0): 95
22.   - Heart Disease (1): 89
23. - Predictions saved to `predictions.csv` with the original test data and an additional `HeartDisease_Prediction` column.
24. 
25. ## Notes
26. - The model achieved balanced predictions, suggesting good generalization to unseen data.
27. - The preprocessing pipeline was carefully aligned with training to ensure consistency.
28. - This prediction pipeline is ready for deployment in a clinical decision support system.
