1. # Feature Engineering Report
2. 
3. ## Overview
4. Transformed `heart_train.csv` using the following steps to prepare data for binary classification of heart disease.
5. 
6. ## Feature Engineering Steps
7. 1. **Cholesterol Zero-Value Handling**: 129 entries with cholesterol = 0 were identified as likely data errors and replaced with the median value (240.0) to preserve data integrity.
8. 
9. 2. **Categorical Encoding**: All categorical variables (`Sex`, `ChestPainType`, `RestingECG`, `ExerciseAngina`, `ST_Slope`) were one-hot encoded into binary dummy variables, removing multicollinearity by dropping the first category in each.
10. 
11. 3. **Numerical Scaling**: All numerical features (`Age`, `RestingBP`, `Cholesterol`, `FastingBS`, `MaxHR`, `Oldpeak`) were standardized using StandardScaler (mean=0, std=1) to ensure equal weighting in distance-based models.
12. 
13. 4. **New Feature Creation**: Two interaction features were created to capture non-linear relationships:
14.    - `Age_MaxHR`: Product of Age and MaxHR, representing potential cardiovascular strain with age.
15.    - `Oldpeak_MaxHR_Ratio`: Ratio of Oldpeak to MaxHR, indicating relative ST depression response to maximum heart rate achieved.
16. 
17. ## Impact on Dataset
18. - Feature count increased from 12 to 18 due to encoding and new features.
19. - No missing values remain after imputation.
20. - All features are now numerically compatible with machine learning models (float64 or boolean).
21. - The transformed dataset (`transformed_data.csv`) is ready for model training.
22. 
23. ## Next Steps
24. The transformed dataset is now suitable for model selection and training. Recommended next steps include training models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost on this engineered dataset.
